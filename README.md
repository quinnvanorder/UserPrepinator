# UserPrepinator
This is my first project, and is meant to be both a learning experience, and eventually a tool to create new users for clients of a MSP. Very green at the moment, so the initial commits will be the standard "hello world" fare. This description will be updated when this becomes more of a viable tool instead of the training ground / sandbox it will be initially. 


The primary component to create users for a MSP, the idea being to use a tool such as kaseya to deploy the script and pass variables as needed to build users for clients without interaction
